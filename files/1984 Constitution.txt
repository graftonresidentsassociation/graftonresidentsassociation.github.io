Note on title and membership.

We favour 'residents' rather than 'tenants' (or indeed 'equity sharers') because a) some confusion still surrounds our status, and b) we wish to involve all residents of the flats including spouses, companions, etc. who are not themselves equity sharers.

'Grafton Centre' will encompass private-flat dwellers in Fitzroy St etc. whom it is projected we will invite to join us, they presumably being burdened with a similar lease and similar problems with Grosvenor's.

This of course does not take account of King Street, but it is not for King Street's benefit that we have formed the Association.
