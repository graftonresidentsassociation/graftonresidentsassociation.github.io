<p>Note on title and membership.</p>

<p>We favour 'residents' rather than 'tenants' (or indeed 'equity sharers') <br />because a) some confusion still surrounds our status, and b) we wish <br />to involve all residents of the flats including spouses, companions, <br />etc. who are not themselves equity sharers.</p>

<p>'Grafton Centre' will encompass private-flat dwellers in Fitzroy St. <br />etc. whom it is projected we will invite to join us, they presumably being <br />burdened with a similar lease and similar problems with Grosvenor's.</p>

<p>This of course does not take account of King Street, but it is not for <br />King Street's benefit that we have formed the Association.</p>
