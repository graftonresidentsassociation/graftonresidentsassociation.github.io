The first General Meeting will be held this Thursday to establish the 
Grafton Residents Association. This will enable us to have an official body to
represent the inhabitants of the building, which can be recognised by other organisations.
For this, we need to vote to ratify a constitution and elect a minimal set of committee officers.

These will be:
<ul>
	<li>
		Chairperson
		<br />-Will head meetings, maintain focus and be our most prominent voice
	</li>
	<li>
		Secretary
		<br />-Will maintain records and organisation
	</li>
	<li>
	Treasurer
	<br />-Will create and maintain a bank account for the Association's income and expenditure, being directly responsible for this account.
	</li>
</ul>
		
These positions are largely formal requirements but any resident is welcome to be a candidate if they wish to do so.
 
You can read the proposed consitution online:

</ul>
	
We hope to see you there!
